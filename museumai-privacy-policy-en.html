        <h2>ScubaPlan Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>By using the ScubaPlan application, you agree to the following privacy policy:</p>
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>At ScubaPlan, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This privacy policy explains how we handle your personal information.</p>
        <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            ScubaPlan does not collect or store personal data from users on our servers. All data generated from app usage is stored locally on your device and on our servers at Google's Firebase, encrypted with a key generated when the
            application is first installed and stored in Apple’s Keychain under the user’s account. We do not have access to this key nor the ability to decrypt the data. Additionally, data on our servers is exclusively associated with the
            user identifier created upon registration and is never linked to emails or names.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sign in with Apple offers an anonymous option, and it is Apple that links this to your actual email. ScubaPlan uses Google’s Firebase to facilitate the implementation of this login, used solely for managing the session of the
            registered user.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Use of iCloud</h3>
        <p>
            ScubaPlan uses iCloud to store and sync the encryption key for your data. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is subject to Apple’s privacy policy. We do not have access to this data stored in your iCloud. If
            you consciously delete this key, you will no longer be able to access your data, nor will we be able to assist in its recovery.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Locally Stored Data</h3>
        <p>The data related to your dives, planning, and settings is stored locally on your device. This data is not shared with us or third parties.</p>
        <h3>5. Access to Device Sensors</h3>
        <p>
            ScubaPlan accesses your device’s sensors, such as the depth sensor on the Apple Watch (depending on the models available and authorized for this purpose), exclusively to provide app functionalities. This data is not transmitted
            outside your device and is only stored in encrypted form alongside your other encrypted data.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Service Analysis and Improvement</h3>
        <p>We do not use third-party analytics tools or collect usage data. Any improvements to our app are based on direct user feedback and App Store reviews.</p>
        <h3>7. Security</h3>
        <p>While we do not store your data unencrypted, we recommend keeping your device and iCloud account secure to protect your personal data.</p>
        <h3>8. Changes to this Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.</p>
        <h3>9. Contact</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at: <strong>contacto@arturocarreterocalvo.com</strong></p>
        <p><strong>By using ScubaPlan, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this privacy policy.</strong></p>
